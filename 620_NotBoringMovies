#Write an SQL query to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring".
#Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order.

#All the details from the table needs to be fetched where the description is not boring so description != 'boring' and the id should be odd number 
#thus condition id % 2 != 0.
#The result should be in descending order of rating thus order by rating desc.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select * 
from cinema
where description != 'boring' and id % 2 != 0
order by rating desc;
